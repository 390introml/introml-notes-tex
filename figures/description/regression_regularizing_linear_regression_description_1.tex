\item{\bf Structural error}: This is error that arises because there
  is no hypothesis $h \in \hclass$ that will perform well on the data,
  for example because the data was really generated by a sin wave but
  we are trying to fit it with a line.
\item{\bf Estimation  error}:  This is error that arises because we
  do not have enough data (or the data are in some way unhelpful) to
  allow us to choose a good $h \in \hclass$.
